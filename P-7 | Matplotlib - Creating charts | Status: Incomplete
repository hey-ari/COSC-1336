## Program 7 -- Written by Ariadna Ayala
# Class assignment #7 -- Reference - No Textbook Reference

# This program contains three different charts: Line Graph, Bar Graph, and Pie Chart. User enters numeric data for Pie chart.
# Additional Notes: 
# 1) The Line Graph shows the Cost of 2 years of attendance (60 credit hours) of most
# popular colleges in Central Texas. The data was taken from ACC web-site.
# 2) The Bar Chart shows displays average salary of software engineer depending on his/her
# experience (Intern, Junior, Middle, and Senior).

# === CURRENT ISSUE: 
# The Pie chart only gives one chance to make a mistake in the format of the input. After 2nd mistake you will have
# to start program over again.
